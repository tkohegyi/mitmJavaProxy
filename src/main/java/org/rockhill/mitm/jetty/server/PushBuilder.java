/**
 * Build a request to be pushed.
 *
 * <p>A PushBuilder is obtained by calling {@link
 * Request#getPushBuilder()} (<code>Eventually HttpServletRequest.getPushBuilder()</code>).
 * Each call to this method will
 * return a new instance of a PushBuilder based off the current {@code
 * HttpServletRequest}.  Any mutations to the returned PushBuilder are
 * not reflected on future returns.</p>
 *
 * <p>The instance is initialized as follows:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>The method is initialized to "GET"</li>
 *
 * <li>The existing headers of the current {@link HttpServletRequest}
 * are added to the builder, except for:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Conditional headers (eg. If-Modified-Since)
 * <li>Range headers
 * <li>Expect headers
 * <li>Authorization headers
 * <li>Referrer headers
 * </ul>
 *
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>If the request was authenticated, an Authorization header will
 * be set with a container generated token that will result in equivalent
 * Authorization for the pushed request.</li>
 *
 * <li>The {@link HttpServletRequest#getRequestedSessionId()} value,
 * unless at the time of the call {@link
 * HttpServletRequest#getSession(boolean)} has previously been called to
 * create a new {@link HttpSession}, in which case the new session ID
 * will be used as the PushBuilder's requested session ID. The source of
 * the requested session id will be the same as for the request</li>
 *
 * <li>The Referer(sic) header will be set to {@link
 * HttpServletRequest#getRequestURL()} plus any {@link
 * HttpServletRequest#getQueryString()} </li>
 *
 * <li>If {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie(Cookie)} has been called
 * on the associated response, then a corresponding Cookie header will be added
 * to the PushBuilder, unless the {@link Cookie#getMaxAge()} is &lt;=0, in which
 * case the Cookie will be removed from the builder.</li>
 *
 * <li>If this request has has the conditional headers If-Modified-Since
 * or If-None-Match, then the {@link #isConditional()} header is set to
 * true.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #path} method must be called on the {@code PushBuilder}
 * instance before the call to {@link #push}.  Failure to do so must
 * cause an exception to be thrown from {@link
 * #push}, as specified in that method.</p>
 *
 * <p>A PushBuilder can be customized by chained calls to mutator
 * methods before the {@link #push()} method is called to initiate an
 * asynchronous push request with the current state of the builder.
 * After the call to {@link #push()}, the builder may be reused for
 * another push, however the implementation must make it so the {@link
 * #path(String)}, {@link #etag(String)} and {@link
 * #lastModified(String)} values are cleared before returning from
 * {@link #push}.  All other values are retained over calls to {@link
 * #push()}.
